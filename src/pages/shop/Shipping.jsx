          Quality Control:
        </h2>
        <p className={textStyle}>
          At NU DROP Co we go through several steps to make sure that the
          products you receive are of the highest quality. First, we wear safety
          gear such as sterile gloves while handling all products. Next,
          sanitizing shrooms is another important part of our process. While we
          love our psilocybin trips as well, the fungi that can grow on magic
          mushrooms is something you actually don't want! Lastly, you will know
          that the products you have received from us are sterile be-cause of
          our air-sealed and tamper-proof packaging. Be sure to reach out to us
          if your package appears to have been tampered with upon delivery.

          Legal Disclaimer
        </h2>
        <p className={textStyle}>
          Psilocybin mushrooms are potentially illegal substances, and we do not
          encourage or condone the use of this substance where it is against the
          law. However, we accept that illegal drug use occurs, and believe that
          offering responsible harm reduction information is imperative to
          keeping people safe. For that reason, this guide is designed to ensure
          the safety of those who decide to use the substance. We do not
          encourage using this drug outside of a legal or tradi-tional context.
        </p>
        <p className={textStyle}>
          Note that potency of mushrooms can vary greatly from one batch to the
          next and from one part of a single mushroom to another part (cap and
          stem can have different concentrations). Because of these natural
          variations, chopping or grinding up multiple mushrooms and
          homogeninising the material can help reduce the risk of unexpectedly
          strong (or weak) doses of psilocybin
        </p>
        <p className={textStyle}>
          As always, it's not recommended to mix hallucinogenic mushrooms with
          alcohol or other intoxicating substances. Use carefully, and we hope
          you enjoy our mushrooms as much as we do!
